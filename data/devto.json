That’s exactly what we covered at the latest [“Bavaria, Advancements in SEarch Development” (BASED) Meetup.][meetup]\n\n![Images from BASED meetup](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sthd1ylkicarp3rf9vqy.jpg)\n\nThe speakers shared a bunch of tricks and strategies from their ongoing projects, and I can confirm that it was packed with cool and practical stuff.\n\n[Clelia Astra Bertelli][clelia] presented multiple use cases for vector databases and [shared some of her own PoCs and project repositories][clelia-git]. At the end of the event, she also answered a few questions I had about tools I’ve been reading up on. Super helpful.\n\nRight after that, [Evgeniya Sukhodolskay][evgeniya] walked us through her research on semantic improvements for BM25. It was great to learn more about sparse vs. dense data approaches.\n\nThen, [Monica Riedler][monica] shared her publication on improving RAG by using multimodal inputs and strategies on how to evaluate each model’s outputs after adding a new modality.\n\nFinally, [Daniel Wrigley][daniel] introduced [Quepid][quepid] a really handy tool for evaluating how good your search results or prompts actually are.\n\nIt was an amazing meetup lots of real-world techniques and tips, and the chance to meet people who really know their stuff.\n\nA special thanks to [Tacto][tacto] for hosting the event, and to [Daniel Wrigley][daniel] and [Evgeniya Sukhodolskay][evgeniya] for organizing it. Everything was perfect.

In it, the authors explain this concept of Choice Architect.\n\nThroughout my career, I've always tried to reduce the complexity of tasks and choices to make meetings faster and decisions more practical, but I had never heard the term Choice Architect before, and I loved it. \n\nIn the book, the authors explore various concepts for directing or influencing people's choices, marketing techniques that are present in many things, and that we software developers can also use in our products.\n\nThe authors talk about better product arrangements on supermarket shelves. For us? It would be where to best place the buy button or that sponsored ad or banner.\n\nThey also explore anchoring bias and confirmation bias, things we can use very well during meetings and process definitions, among other topics.\n\nThe book is a bit old, but its latest version has been updated to adapt to more current concepts. As usual, I [listened to each of these tips][audible] while doing my daily exercise routine. The work is narrated by Sean Pratt.\n\nAnd if you'd also like to learn more about these techniques and improve your office life and meeting participation, this book is definitely worth reading.\n\n![Image of book Nudge][image]\n\n---\n<small>\n This is my reading log for tracking progress in my personal development plan.

His work is titled: _[Não Há Tempo a Perder, which translates directly into English as: No Time to Lose][kindle]_.\n\nThis journey through the world of books has introduced me to people who achieved incredible feats, many of them from my own country. I am surprised by how I had never heard of such stories until now. Truly, the best knowledge is the one you seek out yourself.\n\n---\n\nPlease Like, share and follow for more.\n\n---\n\nThroughout the book, the author shares how the development of his personality, along with his involvement with the sea, brought him resilience and how he gradually discovered where his heart truly lay.\n\nHe also describes how he studied and acquired knowledge from people from various parts of the country about sailing, and, in great detail, he explains how he applied all of it to his boat projects, which allowed him to travel the South Atlantic numerous times and pass on this passion for the sea to the next generation.\n\nAs usual, _[I listened to this story][audible]_ while doing my daily exercise routine. The audiobook is narrated by Diego Muras.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t find an English version of the book to share the link.

The Tailwind directives, imports, and configuration reside in `templates/styles/index.css`, which acts as the \"source code\" for the styles.\n3. All the `templates/*.html` files can freely utilize Tailwind's utility classes.\n4. [`.air.toml`][air-site] is tasked with automatically watching all project changes, including recompiling `templates/styles/index.css` using its `pre-build` commands.\n5. `bin/tailwind/download-tailwindcss.sh` is responsible for downloading (or updating) the TailwindCSS CLI. You are responsible ro run it.\n6. The file `bin/tailwind/tailwindcss` is the TailwindCSS CLI itself, which is used by `air` to recompile the Tailwind styles into the `static/styles.css` file whenever changes are made.\n\n\nFor the sake of saving time, I won't delve too much into how Go serves HTML and static files using an HTTP web server—you can easily find that information online. \n\nInstead, I'll focus on the **Tailwind and `air` setup**, as this is critical to getting everything to work smoothly.\n\n\n### Installing the TailwindCSS CLI Compiler\n\nFirst, take a look at `bin/tailwind/download-tailwindcss.sh`, which:\n1. Detects your operating system.\n2. Downloads the TailwindCSS CLI from the official repository.\n3. Renames the downloaded file to `tailwindcss` for simplicity.\n4. Marks the `tailwindcss` file as executable.\n5. If an error occurs during the process, it suggests manually downloading the file.\n\nHere's the complete script:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# file name\nTAILWIND_BIN=\"tailwindcss\"\nTAILWIND_BIN_PATH=\"${PWD}/${TAILWIND_BIN}\"\n\necho \"Downloading Tailwind CSS CLI...\"\n\n# OS detector\nif [[ \"$OSTYPE\" == \"linux-gnu\"* ]]; then\n  curl -L https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-linux-x64 -o \"$TAILWIND_BIN\"\nelif [[ \"$OSTYPE\" == \"darwin\"* ]]; then\n  curl -L https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-macos-arm64 -o \"$TAILWIND_BIN\"\nelse\n  echo \"OS not supported. Try to download manually\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Set permission to make the file executable\necho \"Setting the file as executable...\"\necho \"$PWD\"\nchmod +x \"$TAILWIND_BIN_PATH\"\n\necho \"Tailwind CSS CLI is Installed!\"\necho \"Executable path: $TAILWIND_BIN_PATH\"\n```\n\n### Configuring `air` to Automatically Compile CSS\n\nAt this stage, your Go project should already be monitored by [`air`][air-site]. \n\nNow, you'll need to update the configuration to allow it to **use pre-build commands to recompile the CSS** whenever changes are detected.\n\nHere are the key updates to make in the `.air.toml` file:\n\n```toml\n# ... other keys omitted for readability\n[build]\n  # ... other keys omitted for readability\n  include_ext = [\"go\", \"tpl\", \"tmpl\", \"html\",\"css\"]\n  # ... other keys ommited for readability\n  pre_cmd = [\"./bin/tailwind/tailwindcss -i ./templates/styles/index.css -o ./static/styles.css\"]\n# ... other keys ommited for readability\n```\n\nAs shown in the snippet above, you need to:\n\n1. Add the `\"css\"` extension to the `include_ext` list so `air` watches CSS files as well.\n2. Add a `pre_cmd` to compile the `templates/styles/index.css` into `static/styles.css`.\n\n\nYES!!!! It will automatically execute on every change. BUT it saves you from the hassle of doing it yourself—or worse, forgetting to do it altogether. Let the machine handle the work! :D\n\n#### **Important Notes**\n\n1. Remember to adjust this command when building for production—adding minification, for instance.\n2. Sometimes, your browser might cache the CSS changes, so get used to forcing a refresh:\n    - **Windows/Linux**: Use `CTRL + F5`.\n    - **Mac**: Use `CMD + SHIFT + R`.\n\n### Tailwind CSS Version 4\n\n[Tailwind CSS has made huge improvements in version 4][tailwind-v4], and one exciting change is the **removal of the `tailwind.config.js` file**. \n\nIt has also simplified the way you load directives and settings—allowing you to define them directly in your `.css` file. Great work by the Tailwind team!\n\nHere’s the setup you should consider using, based on a structure similar to mine:\n\n```css\n/* file: `template/styles/index.css` */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@source \"../**/*.html\";\n```\n\nShort, clean, and simple—so much better!\n\n### Final words\n\nThis configuration will surely enhance your development experience. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments.\n\nAnd hey, don’t forget to like, share, or follow me on [LinkedIn][linkedin] or check out my posts on [dev.to][blog]! :)\n\n\n[air-site]: https://github.com/air-verse/air\n[tailwind-v4]: https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#simplified-installation\n[blog]: https://dev.to/getjv\n[linkedin]: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhonatan-morais/",

The book is beautifully narrated by Jonathan Cowley.\n\nThe story of the challenges Tim Cook overcame and the incredible changes he brought to Apple under the immense pressure of succeeding Steve Jobs is truly remarkable.\n\nI never fully understood the passion that Apple fans have, but after reading this book and discovering everything the company came to stand for under Steve's vision and then Tim's leadership, I’ve gained a newfound respect for the brand.\n\nOf all the accomplishments highlighted in the book, what resonated with me the most were the episodes detailing Tim’s relationships with suppliers, his negotiation style, and, above all, his humane approach to leadership.\n\nIt was also inspiring to see how he arrived quietly, humbly, and yet through the excellence of his work, he silenced every critic, earning his place as a masterful leader.\n\nThe book is filled with great examples. I learned so much and highly recommend it, especially if, like me, you’re on a journey to learn new things and grow.\n\n![Image of book Tim Cook][image]\n\n---\n<small>\n This is my reading log for tracking progress in my personal development plan.

The book is narrated by Eric Conger, making the experience even more engaging! 🎧💪\n\nThis book is quite long—16 hours of listening—but in that time, it tells the story of Starbucks from its early days under a different name, through the acquisition of the brand, its national rise, and the many strategies that shaped how the company, its products, and its people evolved year after year.\n\nThe book is both a narrative of the company's journey and, at times, a pitch for its culture. That aspect bothered me a little, but in the end, it’s understandable—after all, we're hearing the story from someone who almost single-handedly raised the capital to start such a massive and risky business. Seeing the dedication and effort from those at the forefront of it all was truly inspiring.\n\nInterestingly, I've noticed a common theme in the books I've been reading about CEOs and major companies: they all emphasize a relentless pursuit of quality at different levels. This really stood out to me. In Starbucks' story, the three key pillars were clear: a commitment to quality, trust within the organization, and credibility with customers.\n\nI learned a lot from these insights—thank you, [Howard Schultz][author-page], for sharing such a detailed and fascinating story! \n\n\n![Image of the book Pour Your Heart Into It][image]\n\n---\n<small>\n This is my reading log for tracking progress in my personal development plan.

    "body_markdown": "## protoc compiler, protoc-gen-grpc plugin and grpc.so\n\nas a first step, we need a healthy php environment to run our client script.\n\nfor that lets use other good docker image with ephemeral containers use the following command to pull and see if the grpc module is enabled, as outout you will see grpc printed.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm  getjv/grpc-php-base php -m | grep grpc\n```\n\n### Gererated static client from protobuff file\n\nNow the grpc image with `protoc compiler`, `protoc-gen-grpc` plugin and `grpc.so` took in place we need to generate the\nstatic services files using the provided `proto` files. \n\nFor instance, here we only use a simple helloworld like the following code. but as a rule, it is a normal action checkout the proto-files from your grpc server provider. BBeloow is a copy of the protofile we are using:\n\n```bash\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\n\noption go_package = \"getjv.github.com/protos\";\n\npackage helloworld;\n\n// The greeting service definition.\nservice Greeter {\n  // Sends a greeting\n  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}\n\n  // Sends a stream of greetings from server to client\n  rpc StreamGreetings (HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply) {}\n}\n\n// The request message containing the user name.\nmessage HelloRequest {\n  string name = 1;\n}\n\n// The response message containing the greetings\nmessage HelloReply {\n  string message = 1;\n}\n```\n\nthe next step is compile this file using protoc. the command is given as follow but we usually execute it using a sh or make file.\n\n```bash\nPHP_GRPC_CLIENT_PATH=src\nGENERATED_FOLDER_NAME=generated\nPROTO_PATH=infra/protos\nGRPC_PHP_PLUGIN=/usr/local/bin/protoc-gen-grpc\n\n${PWD}/bin/php/protoc-29.0.0 \\\n        --php_out=${PHP_GRPC_CLIENT_PATH}/${GENERATED_FOLDER_NAME} \\\n        --grpc_out=generate_server:${PHP_GRPC_CLIENT_PATH}/${GENERATED_FOLDER_NAME} \\\n        --proto_path=${PWD}/${PROTO_PATH} \\\n        --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=${PWD}/bin/php/grpc_php_plugin \\\n        ${PWD}/${PROTO_PATH}/*.proto\n```\n\nThe compile command will read the protofile, compile and add the output for into the generated folderto set those availiable to out project we need to map them in the `composer.json` to auto import the generated protoc files and grpc libs:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"autoload\": {\n        \"psr-4\": {\n            \"Helloworld\\\\\": \"generated/Helloworld/\",\n            \"GPBMetadata\\\\\": \"generated/GPBMetadata\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"require\": {\n        \"grpc/grpc\": \"^v1.39.0\",\n        \"google/protobuf\": \"^v3.12.2\",\n        \"ext-grpc\": \"*\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nand finally, the php code can use the client to use GRPC:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nuse Grpc\\ChannelCredentials;\nuse Helloworld\\GreeterClient;\nuse Helloworld\\HelloRequest;\n\nrequire __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';\n\n// Client gRPC (for windows and mac use: host.docker.internal:50051)\n$client = new GreeterClient('172.17.0.1:50051', [\n    'credentials' => ChannelCredentials::createInsecure(),\n]);\n\n$helloRequest = new HelloRequest();\n$helloRequest->setName(\"Jhonatan\");\n\n\n// Unary call sample\nlist($reply, $status) = $client->SayHello($helloRequest)->wait();\n\nif ($status->code === Grpc\\STATUS_OK) {\n    echo \"Server answer: \" . $reply->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;\n} else {\n    echo \"Erro: gRPC failure status \" . $status->code . \" - \" . $status->details . PHP_EOL;\n}\n\n```\n\nThe output will be a simple \"Hello Jhonatan, like in a regular request response. but in this case is a unary call.\n\nThe environment now is all set and you can keep evolving from this point to fit the proposal to your solution. \n\nYou can check [an article were I explain][1] all the content of this series and plus I show in a video how you to generate static clients and use each of the grpc server methods.\n\nI hope you enjoy the path until here.

The audiobook is narrated by Grover Gardner.\n\nThe book starts by presenting the vicious cycle, or the \"triad of failure,\" which is made up of three pillars: bad decisions, which lead to losing credibility with the team, making it harder to learn, and ultimately circling back to the starting point—bad decisions.\n\nThe author explains that this often stems from key problems that new hires bring with them. They tend to rely only on what they already know, try to prove their worth too hastily, and set excessively high expectations. This combination creates the perfect formula for the triad of failure.\n\nThroughout the book, the author works through each of the ten steps designed to turn the triad of failure into the triad of success.\n\nSome of the proposed strategies include quickly acquiring new knowledge, asking the right questions to the right people, managing expectations with superiors, earning the trust of new colleagues, and finding mentors who have been with the company longer or who have field expertise.\n\nWhile the book focuses on strategies for the first few days in a new role, the tips are so valuable that they can be applied at any point in one’s professional journey. It was great to explore this content, as it allowed me to reassess and apply some of these strategies myself.\n\n\n![Image of book The first 90 days][image]\n\n\n\n---\n<small>\n This is my reading log for tracking progress in my personal development plan.

    "body_markdown": "## Static Grpc Client Generation and extensions for PHP\n\nThe first step to use a gRPC as a client is to generate the static files from the related protobuf file. \n \nIs expected a server application to provide all the protobuf files used to specify the services. Each language has unique requirements to process those files and generate the clients and types, here we will use the PHP way.\n\nFor PHP, this process is a bit more complex because we need to compile the `grpc.so` extension. This step took me many hours of reading and testing, which, by the way, is why I decided to write this guide.\n\nOnce this step is complete, we will have:\n- The `grpc.so` extension enabled in our PHP server, allowing the use of gRPC features.\n- The PHP classes, including the ServiceClient and stubs, to interact with the available gRPC services.\n- The GPBM metadata files, which hold the gRPC service definitions and metadata.\n- And finally, the Request and Response types, which serve as the structured messages exchanged between the client and server.\n\n## protoc compiler, protoc-gen-grpc plugin and grpc.so\n\nAs I did in the last section, I’m going to provide a Docker image that handles the heavy work for us.  \n\nMy image is an adaptation of the [official-grpc-php-samples][]. My version uses php:8.3-fpm-alpine and, at the time of writing, is up to date.\n\nKeeping this image ready to use is important because it essentially freezes the tools you will use to convert and generate the helper classes from the protofiles.\n\nThe benefit of keeping the image as frozen is that you can use it as a [multi-stage Docker image][] and copy the `protoc` compiler, `protoc-gen-grpc` \nplugin, and `grpc` directly to your development or production environment.\n\nThe Docker image, named [getjv/grpc-php-base][], provides the [`protoc` compiler, the `protoc-gen-grpc` plugin, and the `grpc.so` extension.](https://github.com/getJv/article-grpc-php/blob/main/grpc-base.dockerfile)\n\nIt is currently built with `php8.3`. In the future, you can update the image to use a newer PHP version (e.g., `php:8.4-fpm-alpine`) and rebuild it if necessary. \n \nKeeping the pre-built image ensures you avoid the build time, which is approximately **559.5 seconds**.\n\nYou can check the script to [generete the static client files here](https://github.com/getJv/article-grpc-php/blob/main/grpc-generate.sh)\n\nThis is the complete explanation of how to generate these dependencies. You can explore further using all the provided links.\n\nNow, it's finally time to code the project and make use of the gRPC client.\n\n---\n\nSee you in the next article!\n\n[Official repository with example]:https://github.com/grpc/grpc\n[multi-stage Docker image]:https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/\n[getjv/grpc-php-base]:https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/php/echo/base.Dockerfile \n",

I did hit the memory limit a few times, but it worked! So now you have a basic idea of the minimum requirements you'll need.\n\n## Step 1 - Accessing Codestral-Mistral Autocomplete:\n\n1. Visit the [mistral.ai][mistral.ai] website and create an account.\n2. In the left-hand menu, click on \"Codestral\" and generate a new key.\n3. Copy the generated key and save it in a secure location—we'll use it later.\n\n## Step 2 - Setting Up the continue.dev Plugin\n\n1. In the VS Code plugin section, search for: `continue.dev`,\nor [visit the plugin page][c.dev.plugin] to install it.\n2. Once installed, click on the new continue.dev icon and open the plugin settings (cog).\n\n![vscode setting button image](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gbmbyiz57aed6yr8zpjw.jpg)\n\n3. A JSON configuration file for the plugin will open. We'll need to configure it by adding the Mistral.ai model and the key generated in Step 1.\n4. Add the following snippet to the JSON file:\n ```json\n {\n  // ... omitted for brevity\n  \"tabAutocompleteModel\": {\n    \"title\": \"Codestral\",\n    \"provider\": \"mistral\",\n    \"model\": \"codestral-latest\",\n    \"apiKey\": \"YOUR-CODESTRAL-KEY-HERE\"\n  },\n  // ... omitted for brevity\n }\n```\n5. Just save, and now your plugin is ready to use, complete with a nice autocomplete feature!\n\n\n![A gif Showing the auto-complete function](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0riodk2cb8yzk8q07obk.gif)\n\n## Step 3 - Setting Up the Ollama Server\n\nFor this setup, we'll use the Ollama server, an open-source server that runs locally and can be configured to use the Mistral.ai model.\n\n1. The goal of this guide is to show you how to integrate AI into your development environment. \n\n> Installation of Ollama will be done via a Docker  command. If you don't have [Docker installed][docker-install] yet, [check out this guide][ollama] and complete the installation.\n\n2. Navigate to the folder where you store your projects and run the following command:\n\n```bash\n git clone https://github.com/getJv/my-ollama.git\n```\n3. Now, navigate to the directory: `cd my-ollama` and run the command to start the server.\n```bash\ndocker compose up --build\n``` \n4. This command will download the official Ollama image, build it locally, and then start the container. **It will take a bit longer only on the first run, as Ollama will download the Mistral.ai model.** \n\nAt the end, you should see this in your terminal:\n\n![Image of a successful ollama download](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fcwok9boc2ayuhi3bjm3.png)\n\n## Step 4 - Configuring the plugin to use Ollama\n\n1. Open the plugin configuration for **continue.dev** again.\n2. In the JSON file, now add the following configuration for the key: `models`.\n ```json\n {\n  \"models\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Codestral\",\n      \"provider\": \"ollama\",\n      \"model\": \"mistral:latest\",\n      \"api_base\": \"http://localhost:11434\"\n    }\n  ],\n  // ... omitted for brevity\n }\n```\n3. save the changes and restart the vscode.\n\nFantastic! Now you can test your chat feature as shown below:\n\n\n![A gif showing the chat interaction](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bh7dan7812zc0lp49a5e.gif)\n\nIn case you want to expand this and use more features read the [continue.dev docs][c.dev.site] the [ollama][] or adjust [my ollama image][ol-img] as you need.\n\n\n---\n\nRemember to show your support: follow, share, give it a like, and leave a comment.\n\n---\n\n[c.dev.site]: https://www.continue.dev/\n[c.dev.plugin]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue\n[mistral.ai]: https://mistral.ai/\n[ollama]: https://ollama.ai/\n[docker-install]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04\n[ol-img]:https://github.com/getJv/my-ollama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body_markdown": "## Introduction\n\nLet's use a Golang gRPC server packaged as a Docker container for convenience. \n\nThe server's source code is presented here for learning purposes, but if you're not a Golang developer, there's no need to spend too much time on it.\n\nBy the end of this section, you should have a running gRPC server successfully tested using the grpcurl tool.\n\n---\n\n## Environment Requirements\n\nAs a first step, ensure that your development machine has the following services installed and ready to use:\n\n* Linux or WSL (windows is not in the scope of this guide)\n* Docker\n* grpcurl\n\n## GRPC server and  protobuff file\n\nYou may have noticed that this is a PHP-related guide, but we are using Golang server. The reason is simple: *it is not possible to create a gRPC server using PHP*, only clients.  \nYou can read more about this on the official [gRPC PHP page][1].\n\nthe first thing needed to use gRPC is writing a `.proto` file:\n\n```php\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\n\noption go_package = \"getjv.github.com/protos\";\n\npackage helloworld;\n\n// The greeting service definition.\nservice Greeter {\n  // Sends a greeting\n  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}\n\n  // Sends a stream of greetings from server to client\n  rpc StreamGreetings (HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply) {}\n}\n\n// The request message containing the user's name.\nmessage HelloRequest {\n  string name = 1;\n}\n\n// The response message containing the greetings\nmessage HelloReply {\n  string message = 1;\n}\n```\n\nTo keep the leaning curve flat, lets skip the whole aspects of Protocol Buffers specification, please visit the official [protobuff-specification][2] if you want to learn more, but it is not essential at this point. \n\nThe most relevant points you should know are:\n1. There are two available services: `SayHello` and `StreamGreetings`.\n2. Both are using the same request and response types: `HelloRequest` and `HelloReply`.\n\nNow that we know what is defined in the proto file, we basically understand what to expect from the gRPC server we are going to interact with.\n  \nTo download and start the gRPC server, run the following command:\n  \n`docker run --rm --name grpc -p 50051:50051 getjv/go-grpc-server`\n\nThis command pulls a ready-to-use image from my [personal Docker Hub][3]. The expected output should be:\n\n```bash\n   $ docker run --rm --name grpc -p 50051:50051 getjv/hello-go-grpc-server\n   Unable to find image 'getjv/hello-go-grpc-server:latest' locally\n   [...intentionally ommited...]\n   Status: Downloaded newer image for getjv/hello-go-grpc-server:latest\n   2025/01/19 12:47:38 GreeterSrvImpl listening at [::]:50051\n```\n\nAt this point, your terminal should be locked and listening for gRPC calls on port `50051`. Now it is time to test the service using [grpcurl-tool][4].\n\ngRPCurl is a super handy tool, and the main commands are:\n\n* `grpcurl -plaintext [::]:50051 list` – lists the available services.\n* `grpcurl -plaintext [::]:50051 describe <ServiceName>` – provides more information about the available service.\n* `grpcurl -plaintext -d '<JSON-Payload>' [::]:50051 <ServiceName.MethodName>` – makes a direct call to a method with a payload.\n\n\nExecute these commands in order, and you will be able to call any service like this:\n  \n`grpcurl -plaintext -d '{\"name\": \"jhonatan\"}' [::]:50051 helloworld.Greeter.SayHello`\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```bash\n$ grpcurl -plaintext -d '{\"name\": \"jhonatan\"}' [::]:50051 helloworld.Greeter.SayHello\n{\n  \"message\": \"Hello jhonatan\"\n}\n\n```\n\nWith these steps, we now have the server running and functioning properly. its time to prepare the php side. \n\nSee you in the next post\n\n---\n\n\n[1]:https://grpc.io/docs/languages/php/quickstart/\n[2]:https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/\n[3]:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/getjv/go-grpc-server/general\n[4]:https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl\n",

So, I decided to write about it in the hope that it can help and support many other developers out there. \n\nIf you find it useful, please like and share!\n\n---\n\nNowadays, the most common way to share data among services is through APIs using JSON/REST. This approach is simple to implement and probably is the way you have building your services. \n\nHowever, as services scale to handle high traffic volumes, side effects begin to emerge, such as slower performance across services and excessive consumption of network resources.\n\nA modern and effective alternative is to use gRPC. While it is slightly more complex than the JSON-based approach, gRPC offers significant advantages, including faster performance, enhanced security, and developer-friendly tools. \n\nRecently, LinkedIn shared a [talk on InfoQ][1] detailing a successful migration from JSON to gRPC. It’s worth checking out — the results and benefits of this transition might positively surprise you.\n\nI’ve been using gRPC in some applications, and while the learning curve was a bit steep at first, I decided to write this guide to help those who are just starting to explore this exciting technology. \n\nMy goal is to provide you with a deep-dive experience that makes the journey easier and more enjoyable. I hope this guide can serve as a valuable resource as you step into the world of gRPC!\n\n## Our Workplan\n\nThis guide will show you how to set up a development environment for working with gRPC and interacting with services using a PHP client.\n\nThe goal is to provide a straightforward approach that minimizes effort and offers a low learning curve.\n\nAs such, I won’t delve into basic concepts here. If you need an introduction to the fundamentals, please take some time to explore the following links:\n\n- [What is GRPC][2]\n- [How to Start with GRPC and PHP][3]\n- [gRPC overview e techniques][4]\n- [Official repository with example][5]\n\nThe guide goals are allowing you to:\n\n1. Start a Server gRPC and use .proto files\n2. Generate Static Grpc Clients using precompiled extensions for PHP\n3. Interacting between server and client with Unary and Streams calls\n\n---\nIn the next article we are going to start a gRPC server with GoLang to allow us use PHP gRPC clients. keep tuned.\n\n\n[1]: https://www.infoq.com/presentations/grpc-restli/\n[2]: https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/\n[3]: https://grpc.io/docs/languages/php/quickstart/\n[4]: https://grpc.io/docs/guides/\n[5]: https://github.com/grpc/grpc",

This time, it was focused on beginner tips for developing [Personal Branding][1].\n\nThis is a stage I’m determined to conquer as quickly as possible. I want my brand to arrive ahead of me, opening doors with future businesses and clients even before I step into the room.\n\nFor instance, being invited to interviews instead of having to apply for them. Or having the ability to skip those useless LeetCode tests or the task of coding small apps in every hiring process. If my work and reputation are already known, these steps could easily be negotiated!\n\nI’m really proud of my professional career so far, but I believe I’ve left a few loose ends when it comes to properly promoting my \"professional brand.\" I think now is a great time to focus on that. As the book says: _\"The best time to build your network is when you don’t need its results.\"_\n\nRegarding this book on [Personal Branding][1], it contains several small tips—most of which I was already familiar with—but overall, it was good to revisit those concepts. As part of my goal to go through various books, I can confidently say that, yes, it was worth listening to it from start to finish.\n\nThe book is a bit long, and the content can be tedious at times. That’s why I listened to it intermittently while working through others on my reading list. After a few weeks, I finally completed it. If you’ve never explored the topic of personal branding, this is a good starting point.\n\n![Image of the book: Personal branding for dummies][2]\n\n[1]:https://amzn.to/4h8v8YQ\n[2]:https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tq34zyzciqsls9nv4tfm.png\n\n---\n<small>\nThis post is part of my personal development plan's reading log.\nLinks may participate of referral program. \n</small>",

Keep learning at all times.\n3. Fight against your ego—don’t let success go to your head.\n4. Don’t tell yourself stories—your path hasn’t been linear.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the book and the examples shared by the author.

    "body_markdown": "\nFor a long time I have wanted to code a solution to share the same session between different systems that rely on session and cookie authentication, not tokens, JWT or any other oAuth solution.\n\nDuring my studies, I programmed a Symfony bundle called [jpm/session-sharing-bundle](https://packagist.org/packages/jpm/session-sharing-bundle) that allowed me to create a PoC to test my proposal. Visit my [PoC video demonstration](https://youtu.be/g-CefwgGgqM) to see how it works with a \"real\" example.\n\n## Summary of the idea concept\n\nBut to give you an idea of how it works, it's pretty simple: \n\n1. the solution is that the middleware intercepts the requests to create and restore the session when needed. \n2. the data transfer is cryptographic with **Sync** key, checksum and permission list on both sides.\n3. only the SessionId is transferred, so to recover the data all connected units should use the REDIS connection. \n\n## Flow of data inside the communication\n\n1. The unknown user access `http://remote.test`\n2. The request is intercepted by the `SessionManagerSubscriber` the user is redirected (HTTP 302) to the identity provider using a callback info\n3. The IDP (Host) receives a GET request: `http://host-idp.test/login?callback=aHR0cDovL3JlbW90ZS50ZXN0`.\n4. The `RemoteAuthSubscriber` from IDP (Host) intercepts the call, decodes the callback parameter, extracts the domain, and confirms if it belongs to the allowed list of domains (`JPM_KNOWN_REMOTE_HOSTS`) \n   - if not: it will do/ask the auth but will not redirect to the unknown requester.\n5. Once the request is validated, the IDP verifies if the user has a valid session open.\n   - if not: the auth form from IDP is shown to the user and the callback parameter is kept.\n6. Once the session is created (or exists) the `sessionID` is encrypted using the sync key ad the defuse lib.\n7. Now the user is redirected back to the callback URL with the token param holding the encrypted value.\n8. Now the remote app receives a request: `http://remote.test?token=ZGVmNTAyMDAwYjliZDI5ODU5NGQxYzQwYTE...`\n9. Again the `SessionManagerSubscriber` intercepts the request but now once it finds the token it decodes, decrypts, restores the session and finally lets the identified user access the resource.\n    - if the given session is not valid/found: a 403 is thrown and stops the loop.\nNow the remote app receives a request: `http://remote.test?token=ZGVmNTAyMDAwYjliZDI5ODU5NGQxYzQwYTE...`\nAgain the SessionManagerSubscriber intercepts the request but now once it find the token it decodes, decrypts, restores the session and finally let the identified user access the resource.\nif the given session is not valid/found: a 403 is throw and stops the loop.\n\n## Note of responsibility \n\nA note of responsibility has been added to the library README, but I will post again here. This bundle and the POC were developed as a study case. So is not ready or recommended to use in production, but it can help you to expand and develop your own way to do.\n \n\n",

If you wish get the final example use the brach related to the step two.\n\n## Step 1: Export a component from App-1\n\nNow in the `app-1` we will install the federation lib and export the component to be used by the `app-container` (host) follow the dots:\n\nIn your terminal go to `app-1` folder and run: \n\n   ```bash\n   npm install @originjs/vite-plugin-federation --save-dev\n   ```\n\nNow open the `vite.config.js` and add the federation config\n\n   ```javascript\n   import { defineConfig } from 'vite'\n   import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\n   import federation from \"@originjs/vite-plugin-federation\";\n\n   // https://vitejs.dev/config/\n   export default defineConfig({\n     plugins: [\n         react(),\n         federation({\n           name: 'remote-app', // name of the fed group...\n           filename: 'remoteEntry.js', // default file name\n           // Modules to expose\n           exposes: { \n             './Button': './src/components/Button.jsx',\n           },\n           shared: ['react','react-dom'] // libs/deps to be shared\n         })\n     ],\n     build: {\n       target: 'esnext' // needed to final build\n     },\n   })\n   ```\n\nThe important lines has comments to help you. but now we need to create the component we mapped. Create the componente: `/src/components/Button.jsx'`\n\n   ```javascript\n   import React, {useEffect, useState} from \"react\";\n   const Button = () => {\n       const [count,setCount] = useState(0)\n       return <button\n           onClick={() => setCount(count +1)}\n       > BTN APP 1: {count} </button>\n   }\n   export default Button\n   ``` \n\nOnce the `vite devServer` do not generate physical files we need to `build` and `preview` our `app-1` code. To do that open your `package.json` file and add this script:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // others attributes\n   \"scripts\": {\n       // others cmds...\n       \"preview\": \"tsc && vite build && vite preview --port=5001 --strictPort\"\n   },\n   ```\n Note the we added to preview command the `&& vite build` to generate the files and `&& vite preview --port=5001 --strictPort` to serve the files and force to be strict the port we need.\n\nThis port lock is super important because our host will save the remote uri address. Now just run `npm run preview` and once you access `http://127.0.0.1:5001/assets/remoteEntry.js` you should see some content... For the app-1 we are done.\n\n## Step 2 - Importing the Exported component into a host app.\n\nThe host config is super simple:\n\nGo to `app-container` and install the federation lib too: \n```bash\nnpm install @originjs/vite-plugin-federation --save-dev\n``` \n\nnow add the federation plugin to your `app-container/vite.config.ts` and add the following:\n\n```javascript\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport federation from \"@originjs/vite-plugin-federation\";\n\n// https://vitejs.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n      react(),\n      federation({\n        name: 'host-app',\n        remotes: {\n          remoteApp: // is the name set on remote but in camelCase \"http://localhost:5001/assets/remoteEntry.js\",\n        },\n        shared: ['react','react-dom'] \n      })\n  ],\n})\n\n```\nNow just the remote component as a normal component. go to `app-container/App.tsx` and import the component as following:\n\n \n```javascript\nimport MyButton from 'remoteApp/Button\nconst App = () => {\n   return <> <MyButton/> </>\n}\nexport default App\n  \n```\n\nTake a note take about the component namings: \n- `remoteApp` is the name you map on vite federation plugin on host side and \n- `Button` is the mapped name of the component on remote project (`app-1`)\n\nNow just run `npm run dev` and once `app-container` is on it will remote load the button from `app-1` project.\n\n## Next steps\n\nThis is basically what is needed to work with federation and micro frontends. Here we just export/import a component but is possible to do the same with the state.\n\nTo integrate micro-frontend from different projects like Angular.js or Vue.js [visit the examples in the library](https://github.com/originjs/vite-plugin-federation#example-projects)\n\nYou can [checkout my project example](https://github.com/getJv/getjv-micro-fe-react/tree/step2-add-federation) to support your study or [watch my video about this post](https://youtu.be/ymaPetOe6Zg), there I just execute the steps I described here.\n\nI suggest you to [check the video from Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-nchkL9yIg&ab_channel=JackHerrington) there he shows more examples about how to use federation and mono-repo.\n\nThats it. if this was useful to you please like and share. \n\nSee you!\n",

The README file will offer extra instructions to you.\n\n## Project scaffold and usage\n\n![Project scaffold. Next section descripes each entry](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l195n9wrvgt39zea6ogc.png)\n\n```\nphp-nginx/ -> Main Project folder\n   config/ -> Config shared between host and container\n      nginx -> Hold ngnix configuration\n         default.config -> each file here maps a host\n   docker-compose.yml -> manager your containers\n   dockerFile -> Recipe to build your dev environment\n   workspace -> Place to add your projects\n      -> default/ -> Project defaults, mapped by ngnix.   \n```\n\nThe idea is simple like this, each new project should be added into workspace/ folder and each one should have a new nginx file to set it own hostName and documentRoot. Of course remember to set/map your hostName into your local hosts files. Again, all the steps are fully described in the README file\n\n> It is important to remember this a a image to local development purposes, so to production and pipeline environment you should create another images.\n\nPlease like it, comment and share. \nIf you have any question just write it in the comments.",

No PHPstorm vá em `File > Settings`\n2. Agora vá em `Editor > Live Templates`\n3. Procure a seção `JavaSript Testing`\n4. E clique no Sinal `+` para adicionar um novo item na seção\n![Passos do 1 ao 4](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wurdwp68d9aj3jzbhi5g.png)\n5. Clique na opção `1. Live Template`\n6. Na nova seção que apareceu preencha os campos conforme abaixo:\n   * Abbreviation: \"jit\"\n   * Description: \"Jest Integration Template with MirageJS\"\n   * Template Text:\n    ```javascript\n    import { screen, render, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\n    import { makeServer } from '../miragejs/server';\n    import $Name$ from './$OriginalName$'\n    const render$Name$ = () => { render(<$Name$ />); };\n    describe('$Name$', () => {\n      let server;\n      beforeEach(() => { \n        server = makeServer({ environment: 'test' }); \n      });\n      afterEach(() => { server.shutdown(); });\n      it('should render the child 10 times', async function () {\n        server.createList('mirageModelName', 10);\n        render$Name$();\n        await waitFor(() => {\n        expect(screen.getAllByTestId('child-test-id')).toHaveLength(10);\n        });\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n7. Clique no link `Change` pra informar em qual contexto isso será usado, Selecione a seção: `JavaScript and TypeScript`\n8. Clique no botão `Edit Variables` pra definir o comportamento das variáveis que usamos no template.\n9. Informe os seguintes valores para cada uma:\n   * Name: `capitalize(camelCase(substringBefore(fileName(),\".\")))`\n   * OriginalName: `substringBefore(fileName(),\".\")`\n   * Para ambas marque a opção: `Skip if defined`\n10. Salve as formulas. confirme tudo e agora vamos testar.\n![Passos do 5 ao 10](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qlgdccfqtjq8necgnaom.png)\n\n## Utilização do Live template\n\nAgora basta criar um arquivo js, escrever o acronimo `jit` e confirmar com `tab` ou `enter` vai funcionar assim:\n![Gif demonstração de uso](https://media.giphy.com/media/M6PArOs6X20qPYikUp/source.gif)\n\n## Customizando ao seu gosto\n\nCriar esses blocos de código ajudam muito na produtividade mas nem tudo são flores e sempre haverá algo para ajustar, mas agora vocês tem o caminho das pedras.\n\nSe quiserem conhecer mais visitem a [página de live templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/tutorial-creating-live-templates.html) do phpstorm e também [a página que fala mais sobre cada uma das funções disponíveis](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/template-variables.html) para a variáveis de template.\n\nBons códigos e até a próxima.\n\n<small>Cover Photo by Matheus Bertelli from Pexels</small>\n\n",

    "body_markdown": "Neste guia mostro uma das várias maneiras de configurar seu xdebug em um ambiente PHP com docker. \n\nConfigurar o xdebug sempre foi chato! mas não da pra codar sem ele e agora com sua versão 3 (que ficou excelente) e com docker as coisas ficaram bem mais fáceis. Vamos para a ação!\n\n## Imagem docker\n\nTenho uma [imagem de estimação](https://hub.docker.com/r/getjv/php-apache) que uso pra trabalhar com docker em meu projetos laravel. Então ela e a base de minha configuração.\n\n### Instalação do xdebug 3\n\nDepois de várias horas estudando essa foi a melhor configuração que cheguei : \n\ntrecho do meu dockerFile\n``` \n[ ... outros comandos ... ]\n\nRUN yes | pecl install xdebug \\\n    && docker-php-ext-enable xdebug \\\n    && echo \"xdebug.mode=debug\" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini \\\n    && echo \"xdebug.idekey=VSCODE\" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini \\\n    && echo \"xdebug.client_host=host.docker.internal\" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini \\\n    && echo \"xdebug.remote_connect_back=1\" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini \\\n    && echo \"xdebug.log=/var/www/html/xdebug.log\" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini \\\n    && touch /var/www/html/xdebug.log \\\n    && chown developer:www-data /var/www/html/xdebug.log \\\n    && chmod 775 /var/www/html/xdebug.log\n```\nAlgumas explicações:\n\n* `pecl install xdebug` e `docker-php-ext-enable xdebug` Instala e habilita o xdebug 3 na minha imagem.\n*  `xdebug.mode=debug` coloca o modo de debug desejado\n*  `xdebug.idekey=VSCODE` coloca a chave personalizada utilizada no vscode. \n*  `xdebug.client_host=host.docker.internal` define o host para o docker.\n*  `xdebug.log=/var/www/html/storage/logs/xdebug.log` local para o arquivo de log do xdebug. Como estou utilizando laravel o coloquei nessa path pra evitar problemas de escrita.\n\nApenas esses parametros já instalam e configuram o xdebug no ambiente.\n\n**Atenção:** Diversos tutoriais e post utilizam [parametors das versões 2.x.x do xdebug que foram descontinuados ou que são redundantes](https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide). Sempre leia a documentação oficial para entender o objetivo de cada instrução. \n\n### Verificando se o xdebug 3 esta instalado\n\n#### Método 1 - Modo texto\n\nCom o container rodando entre no bash do mesmo e execute `php -i | grep xdebug` a saída deve ser algo assim:\n\n```\njhonatan@desktop:~/git/my_project$ docker exec -it my_container bash\nroot@e466f2d7bd63:/var/www/html# php -i | grep xdebug\n/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xdebug.ini,\nxdebug\nSupport Xdebug on Patreon, GitHub, or as a business: https://xdebug.org/support\n           Enabled Features<br/>(through 'xdebug.mode' setting)\n[.. várias variáveis aqui ...]\n```\n#### Método 2 - Modo gráfico\n\nAssim como temos o `phpinfo()` para ver a configuração do php temos o `xdebug_info()`. Basta colocar ele num script e o resultado visual vai aparecer como o exemplo abaixo:\n\n![Config gráfica do xdebug](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y66wzk3prozk96gdxfhv.png)\n\n**Atenção:** Observe a seção `Diagnostc log` é nela que serão apresentadas as mensagem de erro e que estarão impedindo seu debug de funcionar. Essa seção é sua melhor amiga e vai te ajudar a identificar seus problemas.\n\n## Configuração da extensão do navegador.\n\nBasicamente temos 3 configurações pra debugar:\n1. `O modo script/terminal`. que não é o foco desse guia. \n2. `O modo 'toda debuga toda request'` que torna seu ambiente lento pois toda e qualquer request vai iniciar usar o modo debug, pra ativa-la se usa o parâmetro: `xdebug.start_with_request=yes`. \n3. `O modo com extensão` que só usa o debug SE a extensão estiver ativada (besouro verde) E o modo debug habilidato no vscode. É esta que utilizaremos neste guia.\n\nPara instalar a extensão em navegadores baseados em chrominium (chrom e edge) [utilize esse link.](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) [Para demais navegadores veja na doc oficial](https://xdebug.org/docs/step_debug#browser-extensions)\n\nPara ativar a extensão:\n1. Clique no besouro com o botão direito e va em opções. \n2. Selecione a opção `others` e coloque a chave como VSCODE (que é o mesmo valor que passamos para o `xdebug.idekey` la em nosso dockerfile) e salve.\n\n![Exemplo para configuraçao da extensão de debug](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b43hq6j2sv5sbt1cz7q9.png)\n\n## Configuração no VSCode.\n\n#### Extensão de debug do vscode\n\n* Instale a [extensão do felix](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug), ou outra de sua preferência.\n\n#### Ativando breakpoints\n1. Vá em `File > preferences > settings`\n2. Na tela de Settings vá em `Features > Debug`\n3. Habilite a opção `Allow setting breakpoints in any file.`\n\n#### Configurando o debug\n1. Clique no contexto de debug do VScode (fica no side menu do lado esquerdo)\n2. Clique para criar o arquivo launch.json\n3. Essa é a minha configuração:\n```\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Listen for XDebug\",\n            \"type\": \"php\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"hostname\": \"0.0.0.0\",\n            \"port\": 9003,\n            \"log\": true,\n            \"pathMappings\": {\n                \"/var/www/html\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n            },\n            \"ignore\": [\"**/vendor/**/*.php\"],\n            \"xdebugSettings\": {\n                \"max_children\": 10000,\n                \"max_data\": 10000,\n                \"show_hidden\": 1\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Launch currently open script\",\n            \"type\": \"php\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"program\": \"${file}\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${fileDirname}\",\n            \"port\": 9000\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n```\n\n**Atenção:** Observe o parametro `\"hostname\": \"0.0.0.0\",` esse é a config que me salvou. sem ela você vai receber o erro abaixo a todo momento pois o host docker não estará mapeado. exemplo dos  recebidos por mapeamento incorreto entre host/docker/vscode: \n\n* `[Step Debug] Time-out connecting to debugging client, waited: 200 ms. Tried: host.docker.internal:9003 (through xdebug.client_host/xdebug.client_port) :-(`\nou\n* `[Step Debug] Time-out connecting to debugging client, waited: 200 ms. Tried: localhost:9003 (through xdebug.client_host/xdebug.client_port) :-(`\n \n## Docker-compose e Video demostrativo\n\nPra facilitar mais e ver tudo em funcionamento adicionei [esse video demostrativo e com umas explicações a mais.](https://youtu.be/s-ot-Zh8LRQ) \n\nCaso vocês queira utilizar a mesma imagem que eu uso aqui esta a docker-compose.yml\n\n```\nversion: \"3\"\nservices:\n  backend:\n    container_name: backend\n    image: getjv/php-apache\n    restart: always\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n    volumes:\n      - .:/var/www/html\n    environment:\n      - DOCUMENT_ROOT_CONTEXT=public\n      - ALLOW_OVERRIDE_OPTION=All\n      - APPLICATION_ENV_OPTION=development\n```\n\n\n## Conclusão e preview de uso.\n\nPronto! com isso você já deve ter o debug funcionando. Ligue o debug no navegador e no vscode, coloque seus breakpoints e seja feliz.\n\nEspero que estas infos tenham sido úteis. Lembre-se de compartilhar em suas redes certamente vai ajudar muita gente que tem o mesmo problema que você.\n\nCompartilhe sempre o que é bom! e dê crédito aos seus autores.\n\nSegue o preview:\n\n![preview do debug em uso](https://media.giphy.com/media/3jEpbvxllrtB4uMlY1/source.gif)\n\n\n## Referências\n\n* Muitos outros posts do stakoverflow e claro a documentação oficial [xdebug](https://xdebug.org)\n* Um agradecimento especial para [laptrinhx.com](https://laptrinhx.com/vscode-dockerkontena-neinophpwodebaggusuru-ji-host-docker-internalni-jie-xudekinai-wen-tino-dui-chu-3354546647/) que me ajudou a resolver o hots:0.0.0.0\n* [Foto de George Becker no Pexels utilizada na capa](https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/foto/1-1-3-texto-no-quadro-negro-374918/)",

    "body_markdown": "Welcome to VueJs mastering the API, today we will talk about the [optionMergeStrategies](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/index.html#optionMergeStrategies) method.\n\nIt provides us a powerful way to create plugins to intercept and modify the default behavior of [Vue hook life cycle](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Lifecycle-Diagram).\n\nNone of the [official documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/index.html#optionMergeStrategies)helps me to learn how to use it, So after some research finally learn a path.\n\n# How to use optionMergeStrategies\n\n1. Create the file: `src/plugins/customMethods.js` \n{% gist https://gist.github.com/getJv/25ca0db2d558180fdd09fec9dbbce6d3 %}\n\n2. Now to install the plugin add the code to your `src/main.js`:\n{% gist https://gist.github.com/getJv/74048e9e9c9ebc17ba5fb9308c7b1b8c %}\n\n3. Once installed our customMethod will be available in any component\n{% gist https://gist.github.com/getJv/aab15bca669272467f3d433e3b81df6e %}\n\n4. The console with print the messages at following order:\n   ![Life cycle console prints](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/g86allfsr6tiqtxmitck.png)\n\nThe customMethod executes him code right before the default createdMethod code, so if you need to run something before the default hooks code just replace the line 8 to another hookMethod from `customMethod.js` or overwrite another hookMethod.\n\n__**If I help you please consider helping me too.

We use it.\n\nLast week, one of my clients complain that his iframe was showing the scrollbar when his height content changes because of the iframed-site-responsivity\n\nWell, that is e real problem. But how to change the iframe height if the host-site doesn't know when the iframe content was updated?\n\n![iframe without auto-height ](https://media.giphy.com/media/6217uC0bdyeNJw9jI9/giphy.gif)\n\nAfter some research I found a possible solution using the window.postMessage, and here goes it:\n\n## Workflow information\n\nBasically, the idea is recursively to send a postMessage from the 'guest-page' as a signal notifying the actual page height. Now on the other side, the 'host-page' needs to has a listener, catching the message and updated the iframe height.\n\n## The code from guest-side\n\nHere I'm using the vue. The most important lines are:\n* line 13: i set the ref of object I want to get the height.\n* line 46: I use the method `iframeHeightNotify` to get the page-height by ref and send the postMessage.\n* line 39: I set the page to recursively send the height.\n* line 43: I finish the recursive operation ;\n\n**IMPORTANT:** As recommended by [Mozzila](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-PT/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) it is not a good choice send messages using broadcast ( the * at line 50), by here is just a sample, set the target origin and validate it on the host side it is on you. \n\n{% gist https://gist.github.com/getJv/341632f70d1a00db00f58d736b98dac1.js %}\n\n## The code from host-side\n\nHere I'm using the HTML and Jquery. The most important lines are:\n* line 16: I set an id to my iframe\n* line 7: I set the Listener and update the iframe height based on the incoming message\n\n{% gist https://gist.github.com/getJv/964314d457669e4cf012bd22c34f26a5.js %}\n\n## Final result\n\nAnd here is the final result\n\n![iframe with auto-height ](https://media.giphy.com/media/EF5S1xVIndLVl4eN3h/giphy.gif)\n\nI hope this content be useful to you. \nMy best wishes See you.",
